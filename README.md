<h1>
  SingLibs - A collection of libraries for computing curve invariants and differential algebras
</h1>

SingLibs contains two libraries for the computer algebra system [Singular](https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/).
The library [difform.lib](https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/Manual/4-1-3/sing_2481.htm) contains types and methods that allow for computing over differential algebras in Singular.
The library [curveInv.lib](https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/Manual/4-2-0/sing_1259.htm) contains methods for computing invariants of curve singularities.

Note that the code of both libraries is written in the Singular specific language.

```
"curveInv.lib" provides functions for computing the following invariants of curve singularities: 
    - the delta invariant,
    - the multiplicity of the conductor: the colength of the conductor ideal in the normalization,
    - the Deligne number,
    - the colength of derivations along the normalization: the colength of derivations relative to derivations on the normalization
```
