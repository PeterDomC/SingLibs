<h1>
  SingLibs - A collection of libraries for computing curve invariants and differential algebras
</h1>

SingLibs contains two libraries for the computer algebra system [Singular](https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/).
The library [difform.lib](https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/Manual/4-1-3/sing_2481.htm) contains types and methods that allow for computing over differential algebras in Singular.
The library [curveInv.lib](https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/Manual/4-2-0/sing_1259.htm) contains methods for computing curve invariants.

```
Note that the code is written in the Singular specific language.

A more detailed documentation of both libraries can be found in the code and in my master's thesis, which is added to the repository.
